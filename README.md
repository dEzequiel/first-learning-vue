# Type Vue

The second part of my Vue learning process can be found [here](https://github.com/dEzequiel/type-vue-2) with a Vue project setup and TypeScript as main language.

This repository is a collection of exercises done during my Vue learning process guided by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller) course on Udemy called [Vue - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/).

I also attach my personal notes taken during the learning time. You can find them in my [Notion](https://elegant-radium-f35.notion.site/Vue-a95d5fd07cc84933aef96ab9ed6634a3).
